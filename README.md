# PDFMerger
A PDF merger created to help ease the difficulty of finding an online reliable and easy to use pdf combiner for my school work pdf files. Additionally, the AI allows for multiple varying topics of pdfs to be merged simultaneously into separately identified topics. 

Programmed using Python, the PDFMerger takes in a directory path and offers the user to input files through console or voice command, allowing for hands free access, something I've always wished that online applications had, overcoming the issue of needing to alt+tab between windows and reorder files.
